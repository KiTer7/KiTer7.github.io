# Team 2116 GovHack 2023 participation

The main aim of this project is to show the different methods available for transportation of freight domestically. Moreover, these methods are compared by key metrics such as cost, speed, delivery time, etc. and are weighted to be in line with the user's priorities.
For example, delievering life saving medicine which has a small timeframe in that it can be used safely has vastly different priorities for its transportation than raw iron ore, which needs to be moved from the mine to iron- and steelworks.

Therefore, our project aims to combine all these factors and provide a transparent and uniquely beneficial way of getting goods delievered; With the use of all available forms of freight transportation and the individual weighting system there are many options available for users to determine which delivery option suits them best.
